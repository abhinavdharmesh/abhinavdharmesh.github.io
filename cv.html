  <h2>Research & Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Atmospheric Modeling for Cosmic Ray Air Shower Simulations</strong> (2024 – Present)<br>
  Conducted comparative study of shower maximum depth (X<sub>max</sub>) in vertical proton showers using CORSIKA 7.7550 with GDAS-derived atmospheric profiles. Simulated 10<sup>13</sup> eV showers at Agra, India (DEASA site) and Łódź, Poland using multiple hadronic interaction models (QGSJETII-04, SIBYLL 2.3d, GHEISHA, UrQMD). Demonstrated that atmospheric fit quality dominates X<sub>max</sub> stability, providing critical insights for systematic uncertainty assessment in scintillator-based air shower arrays.</li>
  <li><strong>Autonomous Cosmic Ray Data Logger & Remote Monitoring System</strong> (2025 – Present)<br>
  Designed a fully automated data acquisition and logging system using Arduino and Raspberry Pi 400 to record muon detector outputs and environmental sensors (BMP180, DHT11). Implemented:
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time data validation, automated CSV logging, and 24/7 autonomous operation</li>
      <li>Remote headless monitoring via permanent ngrok tunnel for instant access to live data</li>
      <li>Automated backups to multiple external storage devices for redundancy and long-term data integrity</li>
    </ul>
  Demonstrates hands-on experience in electronics, instrumentation, automation, and lab-grade experimental workflows.</li>
</ul>
