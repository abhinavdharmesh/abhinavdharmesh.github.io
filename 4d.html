            <h2 class="section-title">1. What is the 4th Dimension?</h2>
            <p>In our familiar 3D world, we have three dimensions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Length</strong> (the x-axis)</li>
                <li><strong>Width</strong> (the y-axis)</li>
                <li><strong>Height</strong> (the z-axis)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These dimensions allow us to describe the position of objects and navigate our environment. But what about the 4th dimension?</p>
            
            <h3>The 4th Dimension in Spacetime</h3>
            <p>In physics, especially in Einstein's theory of relativity, <strong>time</strong> is considered the 4th dimension. The concept of <strong>spacetime</strong> combines the three spatial dimensions with time into a single four-dimensional continuum.</p>
            <p><strong>4D Spacetime:</strong> To describe an event completely, you need four coordinates: three for spatial dimensions (x, y, z) and one for time (t). This unified model helps us understand how space and time are interconnected.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">2. How Would 2D Beings Perceive the 3rd Dimension?</h2>
            <p>Let's imagine a 2D world, like a sheet of paper. The beings in this world, <strong>Flatlanders</strong>, can move left-right and forward-backward but cannot perceive the <strong>height</strong> dimension.</p>
            
            <h3>Introducing the 3rd Dimension to Flatlanders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flatland Experience:</strong> Flatlanders live in a flat plane and can't move in the direction of height.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualizing the 3rd Dimension:</strong> If you were to introduce a 3D object, such as a sphere, into Flatland, Flatlanders would see only a cross-section of it—a circle that changes size as the sphere moves through their 2D plane.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Understanding the 3rd Dimension from a 2D Perspective:</strong> To Flatlanders, height is an incomprehensible concept. They can’t directly perceive or experience it, but they might understand it as a mysterious extra dimension that affects the objects they see.</p>
        </section>

            <h2 class="section-title">3. Do 2D Beings Have Time?</h2>
            <p>Even in a 2D world, beings would still experience time. They’d measure time, observe events in sequence, and age, just as we do in our 3D world. Time is a fundamental aspect of reality that exists independently of the number of spatial dimensions.</p>
            
            <h3>Time in Different Dimensions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2D World:</strong> Beings experience time as a continuous flow, just as we do in 3D.</li>
                <li><strong>3D World:</strong> We experience length, width, height, and time. Our movement through space is unrestricted, but our movement through time is linear and constant.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="section-title">4. Why Do We Think Only 4D Beings Can Move in Time?</h2>
            <p>The idea that 4D beings might have special abilities related to time comes from extending our understanding of dimensions.</p>
            
            <h3>Movement in Spacetime</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3D Beings:</strong> In our 3D world, we move freely through space but are constrained to move forward in time. Relativity shows that time and space are interrelated; moving faster in space affects how we experience time.</li>
                <li><strong>4D Beings:</strong> In a hypothetical 4D world (with four spatial dimensions), beings would move in ways beyond our comprehension. However, time would still be a dimension that they experience, similar to how we do.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="section-title">5. How Does Time Function for 4D Beings?</h2>
            <p>In theoretical 4D spatial universes, beings would still experience time. The fourth spatial dimension offers additional directions of movement, but time remains a separate, fundamental aspect of reality.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Points:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perception of Time:</strong> All beings, regardless of spatial dimensions, experience time.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacetime Continuum:</strong> Time and space are unified in spacetime. Higher dimensions expand our understanding but don’t change the fundamental nature of time.</li>
            </ul>
